## 2. Core Functionality Development (Weeks 2-3)

### Security Tool Integration Framework
```python
# Example architecture for tool integration
class SecurityTool:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        self.config = config
        self.status = ToolStatus.READY

    async def execute(self, target: str) -> ScanResult:
        pass

class ToolOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools: Dict[str, SecurityTool] = {}

    async def run_concurrent_scans(self, targets: List[str]):
        pass
```

## 3. Vulnerability Detection Modules (Weeks 4-5)

### Module Architecture
```python
class VulnerabilityScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.detectors = []

    async def scan(self, target: Target) -> List[Vulnerability]:
        results = []
        for detector in self.detectors:
            result = await detector.detect(target)
            results.extend(result)
        return results
```

### Implementation Priority

   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Custom vulnerability patterns
2. API Security
   - REST/GraphQL endpoints
   - Authentication/Authorization
3. Mobile Security
   - Android/iOS vulnerabilities
4. Smart Contract Security

5. Cloud Security
   - AWS/Azure misconfigurations

## 4. AI Integration (Week 6)

### Features
- Pattern recognition for vulnerability detection
- False positive reduction
- Automated exploit generation
- Risk assessment and prioritization

### Implementation
```python
class AIEnhancer:
    def __init__(self, model_path: str):
        self.model = load_model(model_path)

    async def enhance_results(self, findings: List[Vulnerability]) -> List[Vulnerability]:
        # Apply AI to improve detection accuracy
        pass
```
