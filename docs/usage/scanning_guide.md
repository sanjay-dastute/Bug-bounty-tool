## Web Application Scanning

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to "New Scan" in the dashboard
2. Select "Web Application" as scan type
3. Enter target URL
4. Choose scanning tools:
   - Nmap: Network/port scanning
   - Nuclei: Vulnerability scanning

### Advanced Options
- **Scan Depth**:
  - Quick: Basic vulnerability checks
  - Normal: Standard security assessment
  - Deep: Comprehensive vulnerability analysis

- **Custom Configurations**:
  ```yaml
  # Example nuclei configuration
  rate-limit: 150
  bulk-size: 25
  concurrency: 25
  ```

### Best Practices
- Start with quick scan to identify low-hanging fruits
- Follow up with deep scan on critical endpoints
- Use custom templates for specific vulnerabilities

## Mobile Application Security

### Supported Platforms
- Android (APK files)
- iOS (IPA files)

### Scanning Steps
1. Select "Mobile Application" scan type
2. Upload APK/IPA file or provide URL
3. Choose MobSF as scanning tool
4. Configure analysis options:
   - Static Analysis
   - Dynamic Analysis (Android only)
   - API Security

### Key Features
- OWASP Mobile Top 10 checks
- Binary analysis
- Permission analysis
- API security testing
- Malware detection

## API Security Testing

### Supported API Types
- REST
- GraphQL
- SOAP
- WebSocket

### Testing Process
1. Select "API Endpoint" scan type
2. Enter API endpoint URL
3. Configure authentication:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "bearer",
     "token": "your_token",
     "headers": {
       "Custom-Header": "value"
     }
   }
   ```

### Test Cases
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization flaws
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Business logic flaws

## Source Code Analysis

### Supported Languages
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- Go
- Solidity

### Analysis Steps
1. Select "Source Code" scan type
2. Provide repository URL or upload files
3. Configure analysis settings:
   ```yaml
   depth: full
   ignore_patterns:
     - "*.test.js"
     - "vendor/*"
   ```

### Security Checks
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Dependency analysis
- Secret detection
- Code quality
- Custom rule integration

## Smart Contract Auditing

### Supported Platforms
- Ethereum
- Binance Smart Chain
- Polygon
- Other EVM-compatible chains

### Audit Process
1. Select "Smart Contract" scan type
2. Enter contract address or upload source code
3. Configure Mythril scanner:
   ```yaml
   analysis_mode: full
   transaction_count: 3
   max_depth: 50
   ```

### Security Checks
- Reentrancy
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control
- Gas optimization
- Business logic flaws

## Blockchain Security

### Features
- Network analysis
- Transaction monitoring
- Smart contract interaction
- Token security

### Analysis Steps
1. Select "Blockchain" scan type
2. Enter blockchain address/endpoint
3. Configure analysis parameters:
   ```yaml
   chain_id: 1
   block_range: 1000
   transaction_depth: 50
   ```

## Understanding Results

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Significant security risk
- **Medium**: Moderate security concern
- **Low**: Minor security issue
- **Info**: Informational finding

### Result Analysis
1. Review vulnerability summary
2. Check AI-powered recommendations
3. Validate findings manually
4. Generate comprehensive report

### Report Sections
- Executive Summary
- Technical Details
